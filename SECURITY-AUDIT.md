## Audit Results

### Critical Issues Found:
1. **Hardcoded Whitelisted IP** - IP address 106.219.163.143 bypasses all rate limits (rateLimiter.ts)
2. **Insecure Random Generation** - Math.random() used for password generation (passwordService.ts)
3. **NPM Vulnerabilities** - 3 low severity vulnerabilities in dependencies

### High Priority Issues:
1. **Session Fallback** - Tokens allowed when Redis unavailable (tokenService.ts)
2. **Missing Request Signing** - No HMAC validation for critical endpoints
3. **Limited Field Encryption** - Sensitive data not encrypted at field level

### Medium Priority Issues:
1. **Stack Trace Exposure** - Available in non-production environments
2. **CSRF Token Access** - Tokens in non-httpOnly cookies (intentional but risky)
3. **Missing Security Headers** - No Expect-CT, Feature-Policy headers

### Low Priority Issues:
1. **API Versioning** - No version headers for deprecation
2. **Rate Limit Granularity** - Could be more specific per endpoint
3. **Audit Log Retention** - No automated cleanup policy

### Recommendations:
1. **Immediate**: Fix critical issues before production switch
2. **Short-term**: Implement request signing and field encryption
3. **Long-term**: Add security scanning to CI/CD pipeline
4. **Ongoing**: Regular penetration testing and dependency updates
